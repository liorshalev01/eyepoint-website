# Eyepoint Security: Air-Gap Protection for Remote Work {#1bf8879d650180819f59ef4e65a62440}


> We deliver air-gap security for remote endpoints by ensuring data is only decrypted at user eye level.


## **The Problem** {#1bf8879d650180ebb373dd03eeb3bee3}


Endpoint devices are vulnerable. Attackers can take over apps or the operating system even when strict device security policies are in place. Some organizations prefer the flexibility of remote work but risk confidential data leaks from endpoint devices. Other organizations give up the flexibility of remote work and adopt strict air-gap policies.


Cyber security analysis shows that threats are increasing. For example, research from IBM shows that in 2024 alone, the total cost of reported endpoint device attacks was $XB, and another study from B shows that the total cost of data leaks was $YB. 


## **Our Solution** {#1bf8879d650180f38998d3d4313b8ea5}


Our patented **augmented reality (AR) glasses** provide air-gap security without sacrificing remote work flexibility. Data remains encrypted until it reaches the AR glasses. Even on the user’s laptop or smartphone, the data remains encrypted and only becomes readable in front of the wearer’s eyes. This thwarts endpoint-based attacks since unencrypted data is never revealed to the operating system or network. Even if an attacker gains control of the user’s endpoint device, the documents they’re viewing remain encrypted for an attacker. 


In addition, our solution provides secure user input, such as signing documents or working with interactive web apps. The user input cannot be read or replayed by anyone else.


## **How It Works** {#1bf8879d650180bf9321fb98174b2adf}


As the user interacts with the data through the AR glasses, a visual representation of the encrypted data is displayed on the app screen. Our AR glasses read the visual representation of the encrypted data, and if the keys match, they decrypt the data, and AR overlays the data over the app screen.


Since the AR glasses are disconnected from the network, an attacker cannot gain control over them. Also, the only place where the data can be decrypted is at the AR glasses. This approach creates an “air-gap” scenario where data only becomes usable at the user’s eye level at the final step.


We generate unique encryption keys using each user’s biometric data, ensuring that only the rightful wearer of the AR glasses can decrypt and view the content. Even if the AR glasses are lost, the data remains secure due to the personalized, biometric-based key generation.


**Eyepoint Security mitigates the challenges of securing data in a remote work world.** It brings air-gap level protection to everyday endpoints without sacrificing mobility or convenience. By decrypting data only within an isolated AR device, we ensure information remains safe from threats while enabling the flexibility modern organizations demand.


## **The Market Opportunity** {#1bf8879d65018083bae3d7e24d8d6ee4}


Some organizations prefer the flexibility of remote work, while others prefer strict air-gap policies. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. 

- Remote work networks provide high productivity but a high risk of data leaks.
- Closed air-gap networks provide a low risk of data leaks and low productivity.

Since our solution provides both remote work productivity and a low risk of data leaks, the business opportunities come from both use cases. We offer **remote work with high productivity** for organizations that choose air-gap networks and **remote work with low risk of data leaks** for organizations that choose the productivity of remote work networks.
