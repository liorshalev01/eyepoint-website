# Eyepoint Security: Air-Gap Protection for Remote Work {#1c77da55074f81caaaacdf8775428083}


**We are redefining endpoint security for a remote-first world by protecting data where it matters the most.**


Endpoint devices are vulnerable. Attackers can take over applications or the operating system, even when strict security policies are in place. Whenever sensitive data appears on an endpoint display screen, it is an opportunity for an attacker, and the discovery of zero-day and supply chain attacks is so common that it is nearly impossible to trust any laptop or smartphone hardware or software.


Some organizations value the flexibility of remote work, but risk data leaks from endpoint devices. Other organizations sacrifice remote work benefits and enforce strict air-gap policies to protect sensitive information.


Our patented **AR glasses** combine air-gap security with the flexibility of remote work. Data remains encrypted on a user’s laptop or smartphone and only becomes readable once it reaches the AR glasses and never passing through the operating system in plaintext. This approach prevents attackers from seeing confidential data, even if they gain control over the endpoint.


In addition, the AR environment keeps user input (such as signing documents or interacting with web apps) secure, preventing interception and replay attacks. Employees can open sensitive documents, yet the data remains encrypted to applications or the operation system, preventing data leaks or key logging.


Our solution provides **both** high productivity and low risk of data leaks, serving organizations that currently prefer air-gap networks and those striving to enable safe remote work.
